Here's what `..` and `-R` mean:

* `..` (dot-dot): This is a shortcut for the **parent folder**. It just means "go up one level" from the folder you're currently in.

* `-R` (dash R): This stands for **recursive**. It tells the copy command (`cp`) to grab a whole folder and **everything inside it**â€”all its files and any other folders.
